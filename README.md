MachineLearningExp.com projects
This repository gathers Machine Learning and Deep Learning project published on blog http://machinelearningexp.com
Each file is a separate mini-project. Projects are done in Jupyter Notebooks using python kernels.
***
Update:
Blog is not available anymore, but this repository contains three directories with my experiments content - both blog article in PDF format and code in Jupyter Notebook

1. **Machine Learning: Regression of 911 Calls** - predict location and daily quantity of 911 calls in US Montgomery County (PA). Such project could enable help & rescue teams, such as police, fire department and emergency medical services to prepare for upcoming events and better plan their work.
2. **Deep Learning: Predicting hard disks failures using recurrent LSTM network** - predict failures of hard disks in the datacenter. We will check if Neural Network can predict failure patterns based on disks diagnostic (SMART) data.
3. **Deep Learning: Language identification using Keras & TensorFlow** - identify the language of short text (140 characters) with high accuracy using neural networks
